[Nirvanam](http://www.nirvanam.jp/) is a South Indian specialty restaurant
in Tokyo, Japan and located near my office.
I'm a just a fan and don't have no connection with them,
but I'm making application to check "today's lunch special menu" automatically.
The menu is published on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/NirvanamTokyo/).
